# Ping_pong
This game in Py is a two-player game that simulates table tennis using the Turtle module, an inbuilt graphic module in Python. And each one controls a paddle by dragging it vertically across the screen. They use their paddles to strike the ball back and forth. The game keeps track of the scores for each one, and the one with the highest score wins.
